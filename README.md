# WebElicit 
This is (a simple web application)[https://rgriscom.github.io/WebElicit/] which enables linguistic researchers to time-align text data with recorded speech during the creation of the recording itself. 

## How to use it
### Text
Text data may be entered directly into the text boxes or it can be imported from a CSV file using the "Browse..." button. The CSV import function reads the contents of the first three columns of the CSV file and populates the text boxes with that content, adding any rows if necessary.

### Time
When you are ready to start recording, press the record button on your recording device and the "Start" button at the same time. When you are ready to elicit an item, press the radio button for the start time of the appropriate row, and then press the "Assign time" button. After the speaker has finished producing the elicited item, press the "Assign time" button. If using a computer, this button will activate once when you press the button and again when you release the button. On a mobile device, this button will activate each time you tap the button. 

### Export
Click the "Export" button to export the data as JSON, CSV, .TextGrid (Praat), .flextext (FLEx), and .eaf (ELAN).
